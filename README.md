This plugins allows you to use variable thumbnails, if your filesystem (or storage-adapter) supports it.  
Additionally it has built-in Lazyloading with auto generated sizes.

It will add parameters to original image paths.  
So you are able to save storage and add new thumbnails on the fly.

You may want to delete folder `thumbnails` within folder `public`

## Adding more thumbnail sizes:
- Save new size in the folder of the media management

- Clear shop cache
