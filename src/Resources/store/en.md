Don't waste the computing power and space with thumbnails! With this plugin you can access dynamic thumbnails.  
This plugin also provides the LazyLoading function with auto generated sizes for thumbnails.  
Every product, every picture in the shopping worlds legitimately has thumbnails. These become standard
generated and saved automatically during upload.  
At this point this plugin intervenes and provides the function that no more thumbnail files are created. The only thing that remains is that the thumbnail sizes are stored in the database.  
The thumbnails are then generated and delivered by an external service in real time when visiting.

## Advantages of saving thumbnail generation:
- Save space on disk
- Faster upload of images
- Relief of the server
- Faster backups with fewer files

## Adding more thumbnail sizes:
- Save new size in the folder of the media management
- then run the command `bin/console media:generate-thumbnails` on the console to update the thumbnails for all images in the database
- Clear shop cache

## Which service do I now use for the thumbnails:
Please note that this plugin only provides the function for delivering the thumbnail urls.  
This plugin does not create thumbnails! The corresponding services are used for this.

There are three parameters that are optionally available for creating the link:  
{mediaUrl}: Primarily your config shopware.cdn.url, alternatively shop url  
{mediaPath}: The relative path to the original image  
{width}: The width of the thumbnail

After setting up and checking in the developer tools of your browser, you can also backup and delete the existing thumbnail folder.
